        <h1>Scale Essay</h1>
   <p>
        Scales are "functions that map from an input domain to an output range", or at
       least that is the most clear definition of it available. Scales are a way to map data values and use them for visualization purposes, into a new set.
        </p>
        <h2>Two Ways It's Useful</h2>
     One way that scales are useful is that it can make large graphs with lots of
        information manageable for whoever is reading the graph. Large scales can have obscene amounts of data and outliers, making
        a normal graph incomprehensible. Scales are able to alter these graphs and make them much easier to manage and to read.
        Scales are also able to turn certain data into arrays, which makes the data easier to be accessed in a chart or another
        visualization, therefore making it easier on the user to read.
